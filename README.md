# Project: AI Pac-man

Welcome to AI Pac-man. You can start the game by simply clicking on the start button.

You will be controlling Pac-man using up, down, left, right keys on the keyboard.

The left side of the maze is controlled by you, and the right side of the maze is controlled by AI. Let's see which Pac-man can get the higher score and live longer!

The main point is to escape from the ghosts.  If the ghost eats you, the game is over.

There will be 4 power pellets on the map, which look bigger than normal pellets. After you eat the power pellets, you have the ability to eat the ghosts. If a ghost is eaten, they will be harmless for awhile as they return to their base. 
Power pellets have time limits, so the ghost will turn back to normal after that time limit.

That's all for the instructions of this game.  Have fun and win against the AI!
